## Python

### Hatch

This project uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) for dependency management and packaging.

#### Highlights

-   **Automatic virtual environment management**: [Hatch automatically manages the application environment](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/).
-   **Dependency resolution**: Hatch will automatically resolve any dependency version conflicts using the [`pip` dependency resolver](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/dependency-resolution/).
-   **Dependency separation**: [Hatch supports separate lists of optional dependencies in the _pyproject.toml_](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/dependency/). Production installs can skip optional dependencies for speed.
-   **Builds**: [Hatch has features for easily building the project into a Python package](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/build/) and [publishing the package to PyPI](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/publish/).

#### Installation

[Hatch can be installed with Homebrew or `pipx`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/).

**Install project with all dependencies: `hatch env create`**.

#### Key commands

```sh
# Basic usage: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/cli/reference/
hatch env create  # create virtual environment and install dependencies
hatch env find  # show path to virtual environment
hatch env show  # show info about available virtual environments
hatch run COMMAND  # run a command within the virtual environment
hatch shell  # activate the virtual environment, like source venv/bin/activate
hatch version  # list or update version of this package
export HATCH_ENV_TYPE_VIRTUAL_PATH=.venv  # install virtualenvs into .venv
```

### Testing with pytest

#### General info

-   Tests are in the _tests/_ directory.
-   Run tests by [invoking `pytest` from the command-line](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/usage.html) within the virtual environment in the root directory of the repo.
-   [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) features used include:
    -   [capturing `stdout` with `capfd`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/capture-stdout-stderr.html)
    -   [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html)
    -   [monkeypatch](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/monkeypatch.html)
    -   [parametrize](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/parametrize.html)
    -   [temporary directories and files (`tmp_path` and `tmp_dir`)](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/tmpdir.html)
-   [pytest plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/plugins.html) include:
    -   [pytest-mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock)
-   [pytest configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html) is in _[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/br3ndonland/fastenv/blob/develop/pyproject.toml)_.
-   Test coverage reports are generated by [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy). To generate test coverage reports, first run tests with `coverage run`, then generate a report with `coverage report`. To see interactive HTML coverage reports, run `coverage html` instead of `coverage report`.

#### Integration testing instructions

Integration tests will be skipped if cloud credentials are not present. Running integration tests locally will take some additional setup.

##### Make buckets on each supported cloud platform

-   [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
-   [Backblaze B2](https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803542610-Creating-a-B2-Bucket-using-the-Web-UI)

##### Upload objects to each bucket

Upload an object to each bucket named `.env.testing`.

The file should have this content:

```sh
# .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_EXAMPLE=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_EXAMPLE=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLE
CSV_VARIABLE=comma,separated,value
EMPTY_VARIABLE=''
# comment
INLINE_COMMENT=no_comment  # inline comment
JSON_EXAMPLE='{"array": [1, 2, 3], "exponent": 2.99e8, "number": 123}'
PASSWORD='64w2Q$!&,,[EXAMPLE'
QUOTES_AND_WHITESPACE='text and spaces'
URI_TO_DIRECTORY='~/dev'
URI_TO_S3_BUCKET=s3://mybucket/.env
URI_TO_SQLITE_DB=sqlite:////path/to/db.sqlite
URL_EXAMPLE=https://start.duckduckgo.com/
OBJECT_STORAGE_VARIABLE='DUDE!!! This variable came from object storage!'
```

##### Generate credentials for each supported cloud platform

There are three sets of credentials needed:

1. AWS temporary credentials
2. AWS static credentials
3. Backblaze static credentials

The [object storage docs](cloud-object-storage.md) have general info on generating the static credentials.

For AWS static credentials, [create a non-admin user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-delegated-user.html). The user will need an [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_managed-policies.html) like the following. This project doesn't do any listing or deleting at this time, so those parts can be omitted if you're going for least privilege.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

After attaching the IAM policy to the non-admin user, [generate an access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for the non-admin user, set up an [AWS CLI profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) named `fastenv`, and configure it with the access key for the non-admin user. AWS static credentials are now ready.

AWS temporary credentials work a little differently. [Create an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html), with a [resource-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html) called a "role trust policy." The role trust policy would look like this (`<AWS_IAM_USERNAME>` is the IAM user that owns the static credentials, not your admin username):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:user/<AWS_IAM_USERNAME>"
            },
            "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "sts:TagSession"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Attach the [identity-based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_managed-policies.html) you created for the IAM user to the role as well.

The end result is that the IAM user can assume the IAM role and obtain temporary credentials. The temporary credentials have the same IAM policy as the regular access key, so tests can be [parametrized](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html#parametrizing-fixtures) accordingly.

##### Run all the tests

Once you're finally done with all that, maybe go out for a walk or something.

Then come back, and run these magic words:

```sh
# set the required input variables
AWS_IAM_ROLE_NAME="paste-here"
AWS_S3_BUCKET_HOST="paste-here"
BACKBLAZE_B2_ACCESS_KEY_FASTENV="paste-here"
# leading space to avoid storing secret key in shell history
# set `HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth` for Bash or `setopt histignorespace` for Zsh
 BACKBLAZE_B2_SECRET_KEY_FASTENV="paste-here"
BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_HOST="paste-here"
BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_REGION="paste-here"

# get AWS account ID from STS (replace fx with jq or other JSON parser as needed)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity | fx .Account)

# assume the IAM role to get temporary credentials
ASSUMED_ROLE=$(
  aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/$AWS_IAM_ROLE_NAME \
  --role-session-name fastenv-testing-local-aws-cli \
  --profile fastenv
)

# run all tests by providing the necessary input variables
AWS_IAM_ACCESS_KEY_FASTENV=$(aws configure get fastenv.aws_access_key_id) \
  AWS_IAM_ACCESS_KEY_SESSION=$(echo $ASSUMED_ROLE | fx .Credentials.AccessKeyId) \
  AWS_IAM_SECRET_KEY_SESSION=$(echo $ASSUMED_ROLE | fx .Credentials.SecretAccessKey) \
  AWS_IAM_SECRET_KEY_FASTENV=$(aws configure get fastenv.aws_secret_access_key) \
  AWS_IAM_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo $ASSUMED_ROLE | fx .Credentials.SessionToken) \
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_HOST=$AWS_S3_BUCKET_HOST \
  BACKBLAZE_B2_ACCESS_KEY_FASTENV=$BACKBLAZE_B2_ACCESS_KEY_FASTENV \
  BACKBLAZE_B2_SECRET_KEY_FASTENV=$BACKBLAZE_B2_SECRET_KEY_FASTENV \
  BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_HOST=$BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_HOST \
  BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_REGION=$BACKBLAZE_B2_BUCKET_REGION \
  pytest --cov-report=html --durations=0 --durations-min=0.5
```

## Code quality

### Code style

-   **Python code is formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**. Configuration for Black is stored in _[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/br3ndonland/fastenv/blob/HEAD/pyproject.toml)_.
-   **Python imports are organized automatically with [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)**.
    -   The isort package organizes imports in three sections:
        1. Standard library
        2. Dependencies
        3. Project
    -   Within each of those groups, `import` statements occur first, then `from` statements, in alphabetical order.
    -   You can run isort from the command line with `hatch run isort .`.
    -   Configuration for isort is stored in _[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/br3ndonland/fastenv/blob/HEAD/pyproject.toml)_.
-   Other web code (JSON, Markdown, YAML) is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

### Static type checking

-   To learn type annotation basics, see the [Python typing module docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), [Python type annotations how-to](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html), the [Real Python type checking tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/), and [this gist](https://gist.github.com/987bdc6263217895d4bf03d0a5ff114c).
-   Type annotations are not used at runtime. The standard library `typing` module includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` constant that is `False` at runtime, but `True` when conducting static type checking prior to runtime. Type imports are included under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` conditions so that they are not imported at runtime. These conditions are ignored when calculating test coverage.
-   Type annotations can be provided inline or in separate stub files. Much of the Python standard library is annotated with stubs. For example, the Python standard library [`logging.config` module uses type stubs](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stdlib/logging/config.pyi). The typeshed types for the `logging.config` module are used solely for type-checking usage of the `logging.config` module itself. They cannot be imported and used to type annotate other modules.
-   The standard library `typing` module includes a `NoReturn` type. This would seem useful for [unreachable code](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/unreachable.html), including functions that do not return a value, such as test functions. Unfortunately mypy reports an error when using `NoReturn`, "Implicit return in function which does not return (misc)." To avoid headaches from the opaque "misc" category of [mypy errors](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list.html), these functions are annotated as returning `None`.
-   [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used for type-checking. [Mypy configuration](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html) is included in _pyproject.toml_.
-   Mypy strict mode is enabled. Strict includes `--no-explicit-reexport` (`implicit_reexport = false`), which means that objects imported into a module will not be re-exported for import into other modules. Imports can be made into explicit exports with the syntax `from module import x as x` (i.e., changing from `import logging` to `import logging as logging`), or by including imports in `__all__`. This explicit import syntax can be confusing. Another option is to apply mypy overrides to any modules that need to leverage implicit exports.

### Pre-commit

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) runs [Git hooks](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). Configuration is stored in _[.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/br3ndonland/fastenv/blob/HEAD/.pre-commit-config.yaml)_. It can run locally before each commit (hence "pre-commit"), or on different Git events like `pre-push`. Pre-commit is installed in the Python virtual environment. To use:

```sh
~
❯ cd path/to/fastenv

path/to/fastenv
❯ hatch env create

path/to/fastenv
❯ hatch shell

# install hooks that run before each commit
path/to/fastenv
.venv ❯ pre-commit install

# and/or install hooks that run before each push
path/to/fastenv
.venv ❯ pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

### Spell check

Spell check is performed with [CSpell](https://cspell.org/).

In GitHub Actions, CSpell runs using [cspell-action](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-action).

To run spell check locally, consider installing [their VSCode extension](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker) or running from the command line.

CSpell can be run with `pnpm` if `pnpm` is installed:

```sh
pnpm -s dlx cspell --dot --gitignore "**/*.md"
```

or with `npx` if `npm` is installed:

```sh
npx -s -y cspell --dot --gitignore "**/*.md"
```

CSpell also offers a pre-commit hook through their [cspell-cli](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-cli) repo. A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration could look like this:

```yml
repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-cli
      rev: v6.16.0
      hooks:
          - id: cspell
            files: "^.*.md$"
            args: ["--dot", "--gitignore", "**/*.md"]
```

CSpell is not currently used with pre-commit in this project because behavior of the pre-commit hook is inconsistent.

-   [CSpell matches files with globs](https://cspell.org/docs/globs/), but [pre-commit uses Python regexes](https://pre-commit.com/#regular-expressions). Two separate file patterns have to be specified (a regex for pre-commit and a glob for CSpell), which is awkward and error-prone.
-   When running with pre-commit, CSpell seems to output each error multiple times.

## GitHub Actions workflows

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) service that runs on GitHub repos. It replaces other services like Travis CI. Actions are grouped into workflows and stored in _.github/workflows_. See [Getting the Gist of GitHub Actions](https://gist.github.com/br3ndonland/f9c753eb27381f97336aa21b8d932be6) for more info.

### GitHub Actions and AWS

#### Static credentials

As explained in the section on [generating credentials for local testing](#generate-credentials-for-each-supported-cloud-platform), a non-admin [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) must be created in order to allow GitHub Actions to access AWS when using [static credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). The IAM user for this repo was created following [IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html). In AWS, there is a `GitHubActions` IAM group, with a `fastenv` IAM user (one user per repo). The `fastenv` user has an IAM policy attached specifying its permissions.

On GitHub, the `fastenv` user access key is stored in [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

The bucket host is stored in GitHub Secrets in the "[virtual-hosted-style](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html)" format (`<bucketname>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`).

#### Temporary credentials

In addition to the static access key, GitHub Actions also retrieves temporary security credentials from AWS using OpenID Connect (OIDC). See the GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) for further info.

The OIDC infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform, using a similar approach to the example in [br3ndonland/terraform-examples](https://github.com/br3ndonland/terraform-examples).

### GitHub Actions and Backblaze B2

A [B2 application key](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html) is stored in GitHub Secrets, along with the corresponding bucket host in "virtual-hosted-style" format (`<bucket-name>.s3.<region-name>.backblazeb2.com`).

See the [Backblaze B2 S3-compatible API docs](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/s3_compatible_api.html) for further info.

## Maintainers

### Merges

-   **The default branch is `develop`.**
-   **PRs should be merged into `develop`.** Head branches are deleted automatically after PRs are merged.
-   **The only merges to `main` should be fast-forward merges from `develop`.**
-   **Branch protection is enabled on `develop` and `main`.**
    -   `develop`:
        -   Require signed commits
        -   Include administrators
        -   Allow force pushes
    -   `main`:
        -   Require signed commits
        -   Include administrators
        -   Do not allow force pushes
        -   Require status checks to pass before merging (commits must have previously been pushed to `develop` and passed all checks)

### Releases

-   **To create a release:**
    -   Bump the version number in `fastenv.__version__` with `hatch version` and commit the changes to `develop`.
        -   Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) guidelines when choosing a version number. Note that [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) Python version specifiers and SemVer version specifiers differ, particularly with regard to specifying prereleases. Use syntax compatible with both.
        -   The PEP 440 default (like `1.0.0a0`) is different from SemVer. Hatch and PyPI will use this syntax by default.
        -   An alternative form of the Python prerelease syntax permitted in PEP 440 (like `1.0.0-alpha.0`) is compatible with SemVer, and this form should be used when tagging releases. As Hatch uses PEP 440 syntax by default, prerelease versions need to be written directly into `fastenv.__version__`.
        -   Examples of acceptable tag names: `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-alpha.0`, `1.0.0-beta.1`
    -   Push to `develop` and verify all CI checks pass.
    -   Fast-forward merge to `main`, push, and verify all CI checks pass.
    -   Create an [annotated and signed Git tag](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).
        -   List PRs and commits in the tag message:
            ```sh
            git log --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)" \
              "$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)"..HEAD
            ```
        -   Omit the leading `v` (use `1.0.0` instead of `v1.0.0`)
        -   Example: `git tag -a -s 1.0.0`
    -   Push the tag. GitHub Actions will build and publish the Python package and update the changelog.
    -   Squash and merge the changelog PR, removing any [`Co-authored-by` trailers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) before merging.

### Deployments

Documentation is built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and available at [fastenv.bws.bio](https://fastenv.bws.bio) and [fastenv.vercel.app](https://fastenv.vercel.app).

[Vercel build configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step):

-   Build command: `python3 -m pip install 'mkdocs-material>=9,<10' && mkdocs build --site-dir public`. **The version of `mkdocs-material` installed on Vercel is independent of the version listed in _pyproject.toml_. If the version of `mkdocs-material` is updated in _pyproject.toml_, it must also be updated in the Vercel build configuration.**
-   Output directory: `public` (default)

[Vercel site configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/configuration) is specified in _vercel.json_.
